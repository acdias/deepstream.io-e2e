      And all servers come back up

    When client B connects and logs into server 1
      And client C connects and logs into server 2
      And client D connects and logs into server 3

    Then client A receives at least one "CONNECTION" error "CONNECTION_ERROR"
		And client "A" is notified that clients "B,C,D" logged in

    When client B logs out
        And client C logs out
        And client D logs out
